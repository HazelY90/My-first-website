                <h3>china</h3>
                <p>China is huge, colorful, and full of contrasts. From quiet mountain
                    villages to buzzing megacities, it's a country where ancient traditions
                    meet modern life every day. Traveling here means tasting endless flavors,
                    hearing many languages, and seeing landscapes that change completely from
                    one province to the next. It's a place that never stops surprising me.

                <h4>chengdu</h4>
                <p>Chengdu feels warm and alive — the kind of place that makes you slow down
                    and smile. It's home to China's beloved giant pandas, where you can watch
                    them nap, play, and munch on bamboo all day. And when evening comes, nothing
                    beats a bubbling pot of spicy hotpot shared with friends. In Chengdu, life is
                    never in a rush — it's all about good food, gentle pandas, and easy laughter.</p>

                <h4>hangzhou</h4>
                <p>Hangzhou feels like a poem written in water and mist. The calm beauty of West
                    Lake reflects willow trees, old bridges, and boats drifting softly across the water.
                    Not far away, Lingyin Temple hides among green hills, its incense smoke rising
                    quietly through the air. And in winter, when the plum blossoms bloom in the Xixi
                    Wetlands, their sweet scent fills the cold breeze — a gentle reminder that spring
                    is never far away.</p>

                <h4>nanjing</h4>
                <p>Nanjing carries the weight of history and the calm of a city that
                    remembers. Once the capital of several dynasties, it still keeps
                    echoes of the past in its ancient walls and quiet temples. Walking
                    along the Qinhuai River at night, lanterns reflect on the water like
                    small pieces of time. In spring, the plum blossoms around the Ming
                    Xiaoling Tomb bring color and life to the old stone paths — a soft
                    reminder that even in a city of memories, beauty always returns.</p>

                <h4>lijiang</h4>
                <p>Lijiang feels like a dream caught between mountains and clouds. The
                    water of Blue Moon Lake is so clear it looks unreal — a mirror of
                    turquoise and light surrounded by snow peaks. In the old town, narrow
                    stone lanes wind past wooden houses and flowing canals, where music
                    drifts softly from open windows. At night, the air fills with the scent
                    of food and the sound of laughter. Lijiang is a place where time slows
                    down, and every corner feels touched by a quiet kind of magic.</p>
