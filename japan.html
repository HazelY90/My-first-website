                <h3>japan</h3>
                <p>Japan is a country where old traditions and modern life blend effortlessly. From ancient
                    temples and quiet gardens to neon city streets and bullet trains, every place has its
                    own rhythm. The country stretches from snowy Hokkaido in the north to the tropical
                    islands of Okinawa in the south, offering every kind of landscape in between. It's a
                    land that balances simplicity and beauty — where even the smallest moments can
                    feel unforgettable.

                <h4>tokyo</h4>
                <p>Tokyo is a city that never stops moving — bright, bold, and full
                    of surprises. In Akihabara, the air buzzes with energy: glowing signs,
                    game arcades, and endless rows of anime shops that feel like another
                    world. Just across the city, the Tokyo Skytree rises high above it all,
                    offering views that stretch from the glittering skyline to Mount Fuji
                    on clear days. Tokyo is a mix of chaos and calm, where every corner
                    has something new to discover, and the night lights feel almost alive.</p>

                <h4>kyoto</h4>
                <p>Kyoto feels like a gentle pause in time. The city is filled with ancient
                    temples, each surrounded by quiet gardens and the scent of incense
                    drifting through the air. In the early morning, you can hear the
                    soft ringing of temple bells echoing between the hills — a sound that
                    seems to slow the world down. The Kamo River runs calmly through the
                    heart of the city, where people sit along its banks, talking, reading,
                    or simply watching the water flow by.</p>

                <h4>nara</h4>
                <p>Nara feels peaceful in a way few places do. In the wide green parks,
                    gentle deer wander freely, bowing softly as if they understand kindness.
                    They walk among ancient temples and tall trees, moving with the same
                    quiet grace that fills the whole city. As the sun begins to set,
                    the light turns golden over the rooftops and the deer's fur glows in
                    the fading warmth. In that soft light, Nara feels less like a destination
                    and more like a beautiful memory you never want to leave behind.</p>

                <h4>Ghibli Museum</h4>
                <p>The Ghibli Museum in Mitaka feels like walking into a dream. Every corner
                    is filled with color, light, and quiet wonder — from winding staircases
                    to the Robot Soldier watching over the rooftop garden. Inside, sketches
                    and tiny models bring Miyazaki's worlds to life, reminding you how imagination
                    can make even ordinary moments feel magical.</p>
